👋 Hi there, I'm Hector!
👨‍💻 I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 6 years of web development experience. Here's a bit about what I work with:

Backend: C# / .Net (MVC, API)
Databases: SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL
Frontend: Next.js / React.js / React Native (Redux, TypeScript, Axios)
Server-side: Node.js (Express with TypeScript)
🌐 I have a passion for technology, but when I'm not coding, you might find me traveling, reading, or playing sports.

🌍 I'm currently looking to collaborate with international companies, eager to bring value with my skills, and learn in the process.
